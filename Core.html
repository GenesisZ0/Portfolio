        <P>
            Hello! I'm Nathan, a new game developer from France, and I've been passionate about the world of video games since I was young. I've always been
            interested in development too. The process of creating a video game has always intrigued me, so I decided to study at Esma Game to learn how to become a gameplay programmer.
            I'm all about teamwork and excellence in game development. I put in the time and effort needed to polish our final product. 
            My goal is to create games that players will truly enjoy and remember by striving for the highest level of quality. 
        </P>
        
        <p>  
            On this website, you'll discover some of my personal projects and group collaborations, along with game jam creations 
            that I've had work on. You can also explore my CV and find contact details to reach out to me. 
            I'm always eager to connect with fellow game enthusiasts and potential collaborators.
